# Mathemagica: Visualizing Mathematical Relations using Haptic Feedback
MIT 6.835 Term Project - LeapMotion + Haptic Feedback + Math

## A Note on Python Version
Currently the Python LeapMotion API only supports Python 2.7, and the files included in this repo are work only for a Windows Python 2.7 interpreter (so like IDLE or archaic versions of Spyder/Anaconda). See the [LeapMotion Setup Guide](https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/python/devguide/Project_Setup.html) for more information.
